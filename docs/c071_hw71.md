## Food aid Health & Wellbeing

**From Good Country Source Descriptions**:

**Description**: Amount of wheat tonnes equivalent food aid shipments (according to WFP) relative to the size of the economy.

**Source**: Data adapted from World Food Programme's World Food Information System, http://www.wfp.org/fais/ (and divided by GDP according to World Bank data).

**Treatment**: In case 2011 data for a particular country was missing, but data was available for other years, missing data was imputed based on time series analysis using SPSS TREND function. Otherwise, countries not listed were assumed not to have contributed (i.e. missing value = 0). Values were then divided by GDP and ranked.

**Neighbouring Countries**:




(worse), Iceland, France, Viet Nam, Qatar, Namibia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, Germany, Belgium, (better)

**My Interpretation and Opinions**:

Wheat equivalent tonnes of food aid shipments (relative to the size of the economy) is related to GDP per capita in a couple of ways. Those who contribute no food aid are dominated by poorer countries, and of countries that countribute food aid, wealthy countries have the highest ranks.

New Zealand is in a good postion overall, and an average postion for its wealth. In theory New Zealand could improve its rank. However as the tyrany of distance has affected other shipping related indicators, this one should be checked for spatial effects.
