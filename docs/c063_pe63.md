**From Good Country Source Descriptions**:

**Description**: Fairtrade market size (according to Fairtrade International) relative to the size of the economy.

**Source**: Data adapted from Fairtrade International, Annual Review 2011-12, http://www.fairtrade.net/annual-reports.html (and divided by GDP according to World Bank data).

**Treatment**: Values were divided by GDP and ranked.

**Neighbouring Countries**:




(worse), Norway, France, Canada, Luxembourg, Belgium, New Zealand, Netherlands, Denmark, Austria, Sweden, Finland, (better)

**My Interpretation and Opinions**:

The Fairtrade market size indicator is sensitive to GDP per capita in both an obvious and non-obvious way.

Mid range to wealthy countries dominate the best rankings, marking a clear division with lower wealth countries.

Less obviously, but just as important, only a small number of countries have a fair trade sector reported, and the presence of countries in the data is heavily weighted to wealthier countries. This creates a non response bias, giving the scores a very different rank to what they would have if there was a more complete data set.

New Zealand is in the top 10, but this is not a particularly good achievement in relation to the limited set of data present. The easiest way of improving New Zealand's rank in this area would be to include more countries.
