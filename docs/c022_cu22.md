## Creative services exports Culture

**From Good Country Source Descriptions**:

**Description**: Exports of creative services (UNCTAD's Creative Economy Report categorisation) relative to the size of the economy.

**Source**: Data adapted from UNCTADstat, UNCTAD's Creative Economy Report (and divided by GDP according to World Bank data).

**Treatment**: In case 2011 data for a particular country was missing, but data was available for other years, missing data was imputed based on time series analysis using SPSS TREND function. Values were then divided by GDP and ranked.

**Neighbouring Countries**:




(worse), Tonga, Morocco, United States of America, Jamaica, Mauritius, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina, Lithuania, Italy, Guyana, (better)

**My Interpretation and Opinions**:


Creative Services Exports is more clearly related to wealth than Creative Goods Exports, with richer countries being almost all in the best 30% of exporters. While New Zealand is doing better overall than Goods, in the top half, we are still generating a poor rank relative to other countries in our wealth band. New Zealand is better than Tonga or the United States and worse than Brazil or Italy

Again, as with Services, I couldn't quickly track down raw country numbers to explore in more detail, so have a similar concern that export volumes may be linked to an unchangable relative physical distances. So I can't really judge how useful it is for the country to try and improve this.
