## UN volunteers abroad Prosperity & Equality

**From Good Country Source Descriptions**:

**Description**: Number of aid workers and volunteers sent overseas (according to UNV) relative to the size of the economy.

**Source**: Data adapted from UNV (2011), Annual report, http://www.unv.org/en/news-resources/resources/annual-report-2011.html (and divided by GDP according to World Bank data).

**Treatment**: Countries not listed were assumed not to have contributed (i.e. missing value = 0). Values were then divided by GDP and ranked.

**Neighbouring Countries**:




(worse), Indonesia, Lithuania, Sweden, Angola, Peru, New Zealand, Denmark, Gabon, Czech Republic, Colombia, Spain, (better)

**My Interpretation and Opinions**:

The number of aid workers and volunteers (relative to the size of the economy) is senstive to GDP per capita, but in the most unusual way seen among these indicators.

The distirbution narrows then widens again as the wealth of the economy increases. I speculate that this relates to another factor, such as management vs worker structures in aid projects relative to the wealth of participants.

New Zealand has a poor overall rank, but a good rank for its wealth, suggesting it would be difficult to improve the rank due to confounding factors.
