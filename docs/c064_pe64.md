**From Good Country Source Descriptions**:

**Description**: FDI outflow (according to UNCTAD) relative to the size of the economy.

**Source**: Data adapted from UNCTADstat.

**Treatment**: In case 2011 data for a particular country was missing, but data was available for other years, missing data was imputed based on time series analysis using SPSS TREND function. Values were then ranked.

**Neighbouring Countries**:




(worse), Georgia, China, Mongolia, Mexico, Mauritius, New Zealand, Thailand, Oman, France, Japan, Finland, (better)

**My Interpretation and Opinions**:

FDI outflow is the investment of people in the economy in other economies. Relative to the the size of the economy this measure is sensitive to GDP per capita, as wealthy countries dominate in investing in other economies.

New Zealand had a good rank overall (being a mid-high GDP per capita country), but a low rank for the wealth of the people. While this suggests room for improvement, I think it might be interesting to see if this is being influenced by "tyrany of distance" effects seen in other trade measures that NEw Zealand cannot do anything about.
