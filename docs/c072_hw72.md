## Pharmaceutical exports Health & Wellbeing

**From Good Country Source Descriptions**:

**Description**: Exports of pharmaceuticals (according to ITC) relative to the size of the economy.

**Source**: Data adapted from Trade Map, International Trade Centre, www.intracen.org/marketanalysis (and divided by GDP according to World Bank data).

**Treatment**: In case 2011 data for a particular country was missing, but data was available for other years, missing data was imputed based on time series analysis using SPSS TREND function. Values were then divided by GDP and ranked.

**Neighbouring Countries**:




(worse), Colombia, Guyana, Norway, United Arab Emirates, Argentina, New Zealand, Paraguay, Mexico, Luxembourg, Kenya, Belarus, (better)

**My Interpretation and Opinions**:

Pharmaceutical Exports (relative to the size of the economy) does match weakly to GDP per capita, but as a minima rather than a maxima. In this repsect New Zealand has a moderately good rank, but a very bad rank for its GDP per capita.

This suggests New Zealand could improve its ranking, but pharmaceutical exports are not something suited to delays in shipping. So as with other export related measures, it needs to be checked if the distance exports needs to travel affects the ability to do well with this measure.
