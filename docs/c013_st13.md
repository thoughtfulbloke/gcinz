## International publications Science & Technology

**From Good Country Source Descriptions**:

**Description**: Number of articles published in international journals (according to World Bank) relative to the size of the economy.

**Source**: Data adapted from The World Bank: Scientific and technical journal articles: National Science Foundation, Science and Engineering Indicators (and divided by GDP according to World Bank data).

**Treatment**: In case 2011 data for a particular country was missing, but data was available for other years, missing data was imputed based on time series analysis using SPSS TREND function. Values were then divided by GDP and ranked.

**Neighbouring Countries**:




(worse), Finland, Czech Republic, Armenia, Portugal, Croatia, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Tunisia, Estonia, Israel, Slovenia, (better)

**My Interpretation and Opinions**:

Number of international publications has a sharply converging range relating to wealth of inhabitants and New Zealand is very well ranked for a country of its GDP.

Similar countries are (worse) Finland and Portugal, and (better) South Korea and Slovenia.

There is not really much scope for New Zealand to improve here.

What I think would be an interesting comparison, that I have not explored, is any relationships based on language families between Journal Exports and International Publications. I am wondering if New Zealand's native English speaking population makes it easier to publish articles internationally in both U.S. and U.K. publications.
