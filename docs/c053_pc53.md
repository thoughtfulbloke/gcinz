**From Good Country Source Descriptions**:

**Description**: Hazardous pesticides exports (according to UNEP Environmental Data Explorer) relative to the size of the economy (negative indicator).

**Source**: Data adapted from UNEP (2015): The UNEP Environmental Data Explorer, as compiled from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) - FAOStat . United Nations Environment Programme. http://ede.grid.unep.ch (and divided by GDP according to World Bank data).

**Treatment**: In case 2011 data for a particular country was missing, but data was available for other years, missing data was imputed based on time series analysis using SPSS TREND function. Values were then divided by GDP and ranked.

**Neighbouring Countries**:




(worse), Malaysia, Viet Nam, Costa Rica, South Africa, El Salvador, New Zealand, Indonesia, Burkina Faso, Thailand, Jamaica, Kenya, (better)

**My Interpretation and Opinions**:

Hazardous Pesticide exports is sinsitive to GDP per capita, as the range of GCI ranks narrows as wealth increases.

New Zealand is the worst ranked wealthy country, and among the worst in the world. But living in an agricultural country with a fragile native environment and strong border controls stopping invasive species, most New Zealanders are going to question the idea producing presticides is immoral.

While there is clearerly vast room for improving in this category, most New Zealander's would feel it is more ethical to gaurd the local environment. So my opinion is while we could improve here in GCI rankings, the sacrifice of species required would not reflect the spirit of the GCI.
