**From Good Country Source Descriptions**:

**Description**: Number of UN treaties signed (up to 2011) as proxy for diplomatic action and peaceful conflict resolution.

**Source**: Number of UN treaties signed (up to 2011) as proxy for diplomatic action and peaceful conflict resolution.

**Treatment**: "On May 15, 2000, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent the leaders of the Member States a letter identifying the twenty-five treaties most central to the spirit and goals of the UN Charter (see: http://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/briefing/law/ilresources.htm). Since 2000, several updates and major new treaties were added, such as:
The Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.   New York, 18 December 2002.
The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.   New York, 20 December 2006.
The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel.   New York, 8 December 2005.
The United Nations Convention against Corruption.   New York, 31 October 2003.
The Amendment to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects.   Geneva, 21 December 2001.
The Amendment to Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.   Nairobi, 17 November 2006.
This indicator counts the number of these treaties signed/acceded/succeeded/ratified (using http://treaties.un.org), with a potential high score of 31 (Annan's 25 plus 6 updates/new treaties).
Recent treaties (since 2008) were not included as states need time to sign/accede.
Counts were ranked."

**Neighbouring Countries**:




(worse), Ireland, Italy, Mali, Mexico, Moldova, New Zealand, Panama, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Macedonia / FYROM, Senegal, (better)

**My Interpretation and Opinions**:

UN treaties signed relates weakly to GDP per capita, as no wealthy countries show a large rejection of the UN.

Because this ranking is almost entirely made up of tied blocks, I suspect (without actually checking the data) that the differences between each block are a very small number of signed treaties. This in turn would mean that signing one treaty makes a large difference in rank, as it shifts a country into being tied among the next better block.

New Zealand, tied in the third block, would experience a big leap in GCI rank if it ratified another UN treaty.
