## Ozone Planet & Climate

**From Good Country Source Descriptions**:

**Description**: Consumption of ozone-depleting substances - all (according to UNEP Environmental Data Explorer) relative to the size of the economy (negative indicator).

**Source**: Data adapted from UNEP (2015): The UNEP Environmental Data Explorer, as compiled from United Nations Envrionment Programme . United Nations Environment Programme. http://ede.grid.unep.ch (and divided by GDP according to World Bank data).

**Treatment**: In case 2011 data for a particular country was missing, but data was available for other years, missing data was imputed based on time series analysis using SPSS TREND function. Values were then divided by GDP and ranked.

**My Interpretation and Opinions**:

The relationship between consumption of ozone depleting substances (relative to the size of the economy) is sensitive to GDP per captia, as welathy countries dominate the best ranks.

New Zealand's rank is good overall but poor in relation to countries near it in wealth, suggesting there is definitely room for improvement in this category.

    mutate(country = ifelse(isoCode == var_cciso, var_highlight, "other")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=X2011, y=gci_rank, colour=country, shape=country)) + geom_point() + xlab("GDP per capita 2011") +
